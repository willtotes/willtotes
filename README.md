## About Me 🚀

I'm a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, currently focused on back-end engineering. I want to revamp my GitHub Profile to make it stand out from the crowd in my job search. This is why I started with software engineering, what I am passionate about and what inspires me: the curiosity about how the digital systems work behind the scenes and the invincible logic that powers the sites and apps. I am passionate about problem-solving, building systems and automation, and the idea that code can empower communities inspires me.

## Vision 🎯
I aim to become a **professional backend engineer** who builds secure, scalable systems and contributes to open-source infrastructure that makes a difference.
